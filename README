Virtual Topic Maps over DNS
===========================

In case you do not know what Topic Maps are, then please work through
this stuff first:

   http://www.ontopia.net/topicmaps/materials/tao.html

This package provides a 'virtualizer' for the global DNS. This means
that forward and reverse lookups can be done (later) with TMQL (the
query language) as if the DNS were in fact a topic map.
